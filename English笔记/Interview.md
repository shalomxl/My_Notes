Hello, I'm Shalom Hu. I graduated from Anhui University. I was attracted by the decentralization concept in blockchain at 2018, and I got my first job in this industry at 2019. So I have been worked in cryptocurrency industry for four and a half years. Now I'm a smart contract developer.

I remember that I worked with fast-paced coding team to build a DEFI project which named Bounce finance. This project is a decentralized platform where users can sell their fungible and non-fungible tokens.

And then, I participated in a GameFi project which allowed assets from Web2 games to be withdrawn onto the blockchain and traded through smart contracts. It also enabled users to top up their on-chain assets to Web2 games.

Lastly, I'm proud
